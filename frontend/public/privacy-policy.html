        <h2>Data storage &amp; protection</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Location:</strong> Personal information is stored on secure
          servers in the United States. When transfers outside your jurisdiction
          are necessary, we will take steps to ensure appropriate protections
          are in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Security measures:</strong> We use encryption for data in
          transit and at rest, access controls, and industry-standard security
          practices to protect data. No system is completely secure; if a breach
          occurs we will act in accordance with applicable laws.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Processing Agreements</h2>
        <p>
          We share data with third-party service providers (hosting, backups,
          analytics, email delivery, payment processors) only as necessary.
          Where required by law, we enter into Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)
          that oblige providers to protect personal information and meet GDPR
          standards.
        </p>

        <h2>Transparency &amp; choices</h2>
        <p>
          We will notify you about material changes to our sharing practices and
          obtain consent where required. You can manage preferences such as
          notifications and certain profile fields within the App.
        </p>

        <h2>User rights (GDPR &amp; general)</h2>
        <p>You may exercise the following rights where applicable:</p>
        <ul>

        <h2>Cookies &amp; tracking technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We use cookies and similar technologies for essential functionality,
          analytics, and optional advertising. A cookie banner on first visit
          allows you to accept all, reject non-essential cookies, or customize
          preferences. We use industry-standard providers and do not use cookies
          to knowingly collect information from children under 13.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our services are not directed at children under 13. We do not
          knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without
          verifiable parental consent. If we become aware we have collected such
          data, we will delete it promptly. Parents may contact us to request
          deletion.
        </p>

        <h2>US privacy &amp; CCPA/CPRA</h2>
        <p>
          If you are a California resident you have additional rights under the
          CCPA/CPRA, including the right to know what personal information we
          collect, request deletion, and opt-out of certain sharing. To exercise
          these rights contact mail@elifouts.net or call +1-US 5139078569.
        </p>

        <h2>Children under 13 &amp; verifiable parental consent</h2>
        <p>
          If a feature requires parental consent, we will obtain verifiable
          parental consent using reasonable methods (e.g. signed form or other
          verification). Parents may exercise rights on behalf of their children
          by contacting us.
        </p>

        <h2>Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain account and content data while your account exists. After
          deletion requests we remove data from public view promptly and delete
          backups within 90 days unless retention is required for legal reasons.
        </p>

        <h2>How to request deletion</h2>
        <p>
          Use our Delete Account page:
          <a href="/account-deletion">/account-deletion</a> or email
          mail@elifouts.net with subject "Account Deletion Request". We will
          respond and verify ownership before completing deletion.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy. We will publish the effective date above
          and notify users for material changes.
